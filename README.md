# Ubuntu Home Server

This repo contains my Docker Compose file and documentation for my home server with Ubuntu.

## Docs
After installing ubuntu and Docker, I created a folder called 'services' where I do all my projects.

Because most of the time I'm accessing this folder through SSH using VSCode I ran this command to allow me to use VS code write/read files when remoting access though the file browser.

sudo chown -R $USER /home/lukanvanderlinde/services/docker-compose.yaml
